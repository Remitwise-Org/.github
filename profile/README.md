# RemitWise 🌍💸

> **A remittance app that helps families save, plan, and protect — not just send money.**

RemitWise is a Stellar-based cross-border remittance and financial planning platform designed for migrant workers and their families. Instead of only transferring money, RemitWise enables **smart allocation of remittances into spending, savings, bills, and protection**, with full transparency and automation.

Built on the Stellar ecosystem, RemitWise leverages fast, low-cost payments and fiat on/off-ramps (anchors) to deliver a seamless experience for both senders and recipients.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Traditional remittance apps focus only on sending money. As a result:
- Funds are often spent immediately
- Families struggle to save
- Bills and insurance are missed
- Senders lack visibility and control

There is **no post-remittance financial planning layer**.

---

## 💡 Solution

RemitWise introduces **post-remittance intelligence**:
- Smart money splitting (spend, save, bills, insurance)
- Automated monthly remittances
- On-chain proof of delivery
- Family-level financial planning

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Example User Flow

1. Ravi works abroad and sends $300 every month
2. He sets rules:
   - $150 → daily expenses
   - $100 → savings
   - $50 → insurance
3. Money is converted to USDC and sent via Stellar
4. Family receives funds through local bank accounts via anchors
5. Ravi can see on-chain proof and usage breakdown
